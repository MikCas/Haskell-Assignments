# Super Functor Factory

This repository contains the skeleton code for the Super Functor Factory coursework.

## Running the program

You can use `stack run` to get Stack to build and run your program. Additionally, the following options are supported:

* `--no-unicode` will use colour-specific characters instead of lambdas to display the conveyor in the terminal.
* `--no-colour` implies `--no-unicode` and also will not use colour codes in the terminal.

When using Stack, the options can be invoked with e.g. `stack run -- --no-unicode`.
