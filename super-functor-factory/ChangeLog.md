# Changelog for Super Functor Factory

## 28 June 2019

* Added support for `--no-colour` and `--no-unicode` options. The `--no-unicode` option uses colour-specific characters instead of lambdas to display the lambdas on the conveyor. The `--no-colour` option implies `--no-unicode` and also does not use colour codes in the terminal.
